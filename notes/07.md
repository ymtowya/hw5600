# Chap 7 Scheduling

## Measurement

* Response Time
* Turnaround Time

## Mechanism

* To improve the turnaround time:
    + FIFO
    + SJF
    + STCF Short Time-to-Completion First

<br /> These are all **non-preemptive** methods.

* To improve Response Time:
    + RR
    <br/> quantum time and other issues. 
<br /> amortization can improve fairness but hurt the average turnaround time.

* To incorporate I\O:
    + Overlap
    <br /> While waiting, switch context and execute other processes. This takes effort to balance between cost of context switch and the overall time.
