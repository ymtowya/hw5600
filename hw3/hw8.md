### Q1

*Q:Run a few randomly-generated problems with just two jobs and
two queues; compute the MLFQ execution trace for each.*

A: Randomly generated 2 jobs, and the results are as follows:

```
E:\proj\cs\hw5600\hw3>python ./mlfq.py -n 2 -j 2 -M 0 -q 5 -m 14 -c
Here is the list of inputs:
OPTIONS jobs 2
OPTIONS queues 2
OPTIONS allotments for queue  1 is   1
OPTIONS quantum length for queue  1 is   5
OPTIONS allotments for queue  0 is   1
OPTIONS quantum length for queue  0 is   5
OPTIONS boost 0
OPTIONS ioTime 5
OPTIONS stayAfterIO False
OPTIONS iobump False


For each job, three defining characteristics are given:
  startTime : at what time does the job enter the system
  runTime   : the total CPU time needed by the job to finish
  ioFreq    : every ioFreq time units, the job issues an I/O
              (the I/O takes ioTime units to complete)

Job List:
  Job  0: startTime   0 - runTime  11 - ioFreq   0
  Job  1: startTime   0 - runTime   6 - ioFreq   0


Execution Trace:

[ time 15 ] Run JOB 1 at PRIORITY 0 [ TICKS 4 ALLOT 1 TIME 0 (of 6) ]
[ time 16 ] FINISHED JOB 1
[ time 16 ] Run JOB 0 at PRIORITY 0 [ TICKS 4 ALLOT 1 TIME 0 (of 11) ]
[ time 17 ] FINISHED JOB 0

Final statistics:
  Job  0: startTime   0 - response   0 - turnaround  17
  Job  1: startTime   0 - response   5 - turnaround  16

  Avg  1: startTime n/a - response 2.50 - turnaround 16.50

### Q3

By setting only one queue. `-n 1`<br />
In this way, all jobs have same priority and stay on the same queue, then they are all run by a RR.

### Q4

This command
`python ./mlfq.py --jlist 1,100,8:0,20,0 -S -n 2 -q 10 -i 1 -c` sets the rate to 90%.<br/>
Just multiply by 10, we get 
`python ./mlfq.py --jlist 1,1000,98:0,700,0 -S -n 2 -q 100 -i 1 -c` which is the 99%.

### Q5

`python ./mlfq.py -j 23 -m 100 -n 2 -q 10 -B 200 -c -M 0` <br>
We get the number by `10 / 5% = 200`, which means that even the job was down-graded to the lowest queue, after 200 ms it got promoted to the top priority queue and can take the CPU for a slice of time, occupying at least 5% of the time.

### Q6

*Q:One question that arises in scheduling is which end of a queue to
add a job that just finished I/O; the -I flag changes this behavior
for this scheduling simulator. Play around with some workloads
and see if you can see the effect of this flag.*

A:

`python ./mlfq.py --jlist 0,40,0:0,30,3:0,30,3 -q 4 -n 3 -i 3 -c`
`python ./mlfq.py --jlist 0,40,0:0,30,3:0,30,3 -q 4 -n 3 -i 3 -c -I`
Without this flag, the job is added to the end of the queue.
Otherwise it's inserted to the beginning of the queue.
