# 29

## Q1

*Q: Use
the call gettimeofday() to measure time within your program.
How accurate is this timer? What is the smallest interval it can measure?*

A: 

[timetest.c](./29/timetest.c)

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ gcc -o timetest ./timetest.c -Wall
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./timetest
seconds : 1669263608
micro seconds : 509943
```

## Q2

*Q:build a simple concurrent counter and measure how long it
takes to increment the counter many times as the number of threads
increases*

A: [simple_counter](./29/simple_counter.c)

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ gcc -pthread -o scount ./simple_counter.c -Wall
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./scount
Final Value is : 10000
time1 : 240078
time2 : 240427
interval: 349
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./scount
Final Value is : 20000
time1 : 277988
time2 : 280694
interval: 1706
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./scount
Final Value is : 30000
time1 : 228002
time2 : 230717
interval: 2715
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./scount
Final Value is : 40000
time1 : 285687
time2 : 290987
interval: 5300
```


## Q3

*Q:Next, build a version of the sloppy counter. Once again, measure its
performance as the number of threads varies, as well as the threshold. Do the numbers match what you see in the chapter?*

A: 

[sloppy](./29/sloppy_counter.c)

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ gcc -pthread -o sloppy ./sloppy_counter.c -Wall
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./sloppy


Threshold is : 2
Thread#: 1, interval: 31694
Thread#: 2, interval: 105328
Thread#: 3, interval: 136551
Thread#: 4, interval: 802836


Threshold is : 4
Thread#: 1, interval: 27490
Thread#: 2, interval: 65497
Thread#: 3, interval: 97846
Thread#: 4, interval: 128696


Threshold is : 8
Thread#: 1, interval: 25312
Thread#: 2, interval: 46510
Thread#: 3, interval: 74025
Thread#: 4, interval: 92477


Threshold is : 16
Thread#: 1, interval: 24243
Thread#: 2, interval: 38617
Thread#: 3, interval: 65388
Thread#: 4, interval: 84015


Threshold is : 32
Thread#: 1, interval: 23682
Thread#: 2, interval: 37147
Thread#: 3, interval: 63491
Thread#: 4, interval: 80996
```

## Q4

*Q:Build a version of a linked list that uses hand-over-hand locking
, as cited in the chapter. When does a hand-over-hand list work better than a
standard list as shown in the chapter?*

A: 

[linked-list](./29/linkedlist.c)

[hand-list](./29/handlist.c)

Normal: 
```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ gcc -pthread -o linked ./linkedlist.c -Wall
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./linked
interval: 279
```

Hand-over-hand:
```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ gcc -pthread -o hand ./handlist.c -Wall
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./hand
interval: 706
```

## Q5

*Q:Pick your favorite data structure, such as a B-tree or other slightly
more interesting structure. Implement it, and start with a simple
locking strategy such as a single lock. Measure its performance as
the number of concurrent threads increases.*

A: [Queue1.c](./29/queue1.c)

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ gcc -pthread -o qu2 ./queue2.c -Wall
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./qu2
Number of Thread is : 0
interval: 784
Number of Thread is : 2
interval: 1521
Number of Thread is : 4
interval: 2412
```

## Q6

*Q:Finally, think of a more interesting locking strategy for this favorite
data structure of yours. Implement it, and measure its performance.
How does it compare to the straightforward locking approach?*

A: [Queue2.c](./29/queue2.c)

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ gcc -pthread -o qu1 ./queue1.c -Wall
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/lock$ ./qu1
Number of Thread is : 0
interval: 2209
Number of Thread is : 2
interval: 3306
Number of Thread is : 4
interval: 6404
```
