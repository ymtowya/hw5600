## Q1

*Q:First, write a simple program called null.c that creates a pointer
to an integer, sets it to NULL, and then tries to dereference it. Compile this into an executable called null. What happens when you
run this program?*

A: [null.c](./null.c)
```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ gcc ./null.c -o null -Wall
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ ./null
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

## Q2

*Q:Next, compile this program with symbol information included (with
the -g flag). Doing so let’s put more information into the executable, enabling the debugger to access more useful information
about variable names and the like. Run the program under the debugger by typing gdb null and then, once gdb is running, typing
run. What does gdb show you?*

A: 

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ gcc ./null.c -o null -Wall -g
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ gdb ./null

```

## Q3

*Q:Finally, use the valgrind tool on this program. We’ll use the memcheck
tool that is a part of valgrind to analyze what happens. Run
this by typing in the following: valgrind --leak-check=yes
null. What happens when you run this? Can you interpret the
output from the tool?*

A: `Access not within mapped region at address 0x0 at main (null.c:10)`

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ valgrind --leak-check=yes ./null

## Q4

*Q:Write a simple program that allocates memory using malloc() but
forgets to free it before exiting. What happens when this program
runs? Can you use gdb to find any problems with it? How about
valgrind?*

A: No report of errors in gcc.

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ gcc ./14q4.c -o 14q4 -Wall -g
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ ./14q4
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$
```

Valgrind reports. `8 bytes in 1 blocks are definitely lost in loss record`

```

## Q5

*Q:Write a program that creates an array of integers called data of size
100 using malloc; then, set data[100] to zero. What happens
when you run this program? What happens when you run this
program using valgrind? Is the program correct?*

A:

No error reports.

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ gcc ./14q5.c -o 14q5 -Wall -g
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ ./14q5
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$
```

Valgrind reports error. `Invalid write of size 4`

```

## Q6

*Q:Create a program that allocates an array of integers (as above), frees
them, and then tries to print the value of one of the elements of
the array. Does the program run? What happens when you use
valgrind on it?*

A: All values became 0.

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ gcc ./14q6.c -o 14q6 -Wall -g
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ ./14q6
The value -0 is : 0
The value -1 is : 0
```

Valgrind prints error. `Invalid read of size 4`

```

### Q7

*Q:Now pass a funny value to free (e.g., a pointer in the middle of the
array you allocated above). What happens? Do you need tools to
find this type of problem??*

A: 
Failed to run.

```
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ gcc ./14q7.c -o 14q7 -Wall -g
ubuntu@VM-4-8-ubuntu:~/hw/4$ ./14q7
free(): invalid pointer
Aborted (core dumped)
```

I don't need because it reported already.

### Q8

*Q:create a simple vector-like data structure and related routines that use realloc() to manage the vector. Use an array to
store the vectors elements; when a user adds an entry to the vector, use realloc() to allocate more space for it. How well does
such a vector perform? How does it compare to a linked list? Use
valgrind to help you find bugs?*

A: 

```
