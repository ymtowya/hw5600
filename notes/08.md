# Chapter 8 Mluti-Level Feedback Queue

## Issue to Tap

* Turnaround Time (without prior knowledge)
* Response Time (meet the balance)

## Predict based on history

* Rules:
    + 1 Higher Priority runs first
    + 2 Equal Priority runs in RR

* Attempt:

    + Change Priority
        * 3 New job takes the highest priority (assume)
        * 4a Job takes CPU for whole slice will be down-graded
        * 4b Job relinquishes CPU before slice ends will remain priority
        * Problems:
            + Starvation
            + Gamed
            + Program may change behavior

    + Priority Boost
        * 5 Move all to top queue every period *S*

    + Accounting Better (vs scheduler gamed)
        * (4a + 4b) -> 4 Once used up allotment, down-rated. (no matter how many times released CPU)

* Parameterize the CPU

    + Avoid Voo-doo constants
    + User configure advice as `nice` command
    + Different priority queue has different slice length
    + ...
