## Q1

*Q:How many registers do you need to locate a two-level page
table? A three-level table??*

A: Still only need one, because you do the translation work step by step.

## Q2

*Q:Use the simulator to perform translations given random seeds 0,
1, and 2, and check your answers using the -c flag. How many
memory references are needed to perform each lookup?*

A: 

```
python3 .\paging-multilevel-translate.py -s 1 -c
python3 .\paging-multilevel-translate.py -s 2 -c
python3 .\paging-multilevel-translate.py -s 3 -c
```


For instance,

```
Virtual Address 5149:
  --> pde index:0x14 [decimal 20] pde contents:0xbb (valid 1, pfn 0x3b [decimal 59])
    --> pte index:0xa [decimal 10] pte contents:0x81 (valid 1, pfn 0x01 [decimal 1])
      --> Translates to Physical Address 0x029 --> Value: 1b
```

```
PDBR: 122  (decimal) [This means the page directory is held in this page]

Virtual Address 5149:

0x5149 -> 0101 0001 0100 1001 -> [10100] [01010] [01001]

PDE is [10100] which is 20 in decimal, and the PDE value is

page 122:82 cd ad 9d ab e8 7f af 7f d3 7f f8 92 ca be aa 89 7f e9 99 bb(*) 7f c2 e0 d7 b8 df 7f de b3 8a 7f

value is 0xbb -> 1011 1011 -> [1] [00111011], valid and the PFE is 3b (59 in decimal)

PTE is [01010] which is 10,

page  59:7f 7f 7f 7f 7f 7f 7f 7f 7f 7f 81(*) 7f7f7f9c7f7f7f7f7f7f 7f 7f 7f 7f 7f 7f b7 7f 7f 7f 7f

value is 0x81 -> 1000 0001 -> [1] [0000001], valid and PTE is 01 (1 in decimal)

so the value at [01001] (PA is 0x029) is 

page   1:16 1b 14 19 00 1d 16 12 1c 1b(*) 031917061712051804120d07110e061d02000f191417

1b.

```

## Q3

*Q:Given your understanding of how cache memory works, how do
you think memory references to the page table will behave in the
cache? Will they lead to lots of cache hits (and thus fast accesses?)
Or lots of misses (and thus slow accesses)?*

A:

The directory table would remain in the cache for most of time (because it will be visited after every miss) but the page table would be situation dependent.
