# Memory API

memory allocation in UNIX

## types of memory

* stack memory

or known as automatic allocation & deallocations

* heap memory

all by self `int *x = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));` where 
`x` is a stack variable, pointing to a segment of heap memory.

## malloc()

* `<stdlib.h>` is implicitly included.
* `sizeof()` will be replaced at compile time. So it's an operator, not a function call (which replaced at run time)
* `sizeof(pointer x)` return the length of pointer, depending on you system . 4 / 8
* `sizeof(array x)` return the number of elements in the array
* casting tells the os what this pointer type is.

## free()

* memory-allocation library will track

## common errors

* call routine before allocating the memory
    -> lead to segmentation fault
* not enough memory allocated
    -> buffer overflow
*
