## Q1

*For timing, you’ll need to use a timer (e.g., gettimeofday()).
How precise is such a timer?*

A: 

The precision of the gettimeofday() function is one microsecond.

## Q2

*Q:Write the program, called tlb.c, that can roughlymeasure the cost
of accessing each page.*

A: ![tlb.c](./tlb.c)

## Q3

*Q:Run the script on different machines and gather some
data.*

A: ![tlb.py](./tlb.py)

## Q4

*Q:Next, graph the results, making a graph that looks similar to the
one above.*

A: [Graph](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XXRhgDzcctf1v6FNCl9lcF0BWViOCfXvSMtVfkQdpxs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Q5

*Q:How can you ensure the compiler does not remove the main loop
above from your TLB size estimator?*

A: Compile with the `-O0` argument.

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-74:~/hw/5600$ gcc ./tlb.c -o tlb -Wall -O0
ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-74:~/hw/5600$ python3 ./tlb.py
```


## Q6

*Q:To really get good measurements, you have to run your
code on just one CPU, instead of letting the scheduler bounce it
from one CPU to the next. How can you do that?*

A: Set the virtual machine as single cpu. Otherwise it would be slower in switching the TLB.

## Q7

*Q:Another issue that might arise relates to initialization. If you don’t
initialize the array a above before accessing it, the first time you
access it will be very expensive, due to initial access costs such as
demand zeroing.*

A: `calloc()` can initialize with values.
