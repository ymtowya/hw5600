## Q1

*Q:Now, in one window, run vmstat 1, which shows statistics about machine
usage every second. Read the man page, the associated README, and any
other information you need so that you can understand its output. Leave
this window running vmstat for the rest of the exercises below.
Now, we will run the program mem.c but with very little memory usage.
This can be accomplished by typing ./mem 1 (which uses only 1 MB of
memory). How do the CPU usage statistics change when running mem? Do
the numbers in the user time column make sense? How does this change
when running more than one instance of mem at once?
*

A:

The user time (cpu - us) increases. Would double if 2 instances running.

## Q2

*Q:Let’s now start looking at some of the memory statistics while running mem.
We’ll focus on two columns: swpd (the amount of virtual memory used) and
free (the amount of idle memory). Run ./mem 1024 (which allocates 1024
MB) and watch how these values change. Then kill the running program
(by typing control-c) and watch again how the values change. What do you
notice about the values? In particular, how does the free column change
when the program exits? Does the amount of free memory increase by the
expected amount when mem exits?*

A: 

free increases when the program runs and descreases after it exits.

## Q3

*Q:We’ll next look at the swap columns (si and so), which indicate how much
swapping is taking place to and from the disk. Of course, to activate these,
you’ll need to run mem with large amounts of memory. First, examine how
much free memory is on your Linux system (for example, by typing cat
/proc/meminfo; type man proc for details on the /proc file system and
the types of information you can find there). One of the first entries in
/proc/meminfo is the total amount of memory in your system. Let’s assume it’s something like 8 GB of memory; if so, start by running mem 4000
(about 4 GB) and watching the swap in/out columns. Do they ever give
non-zero values? Then, try with 5000, 6000, etc. What happens to these
values as the program enters the second loop (and beyond), as compared to
the first loop? How much data (total) are swapped in and out during the
second, third, and subsequent loops? (do the numbers make sense?)
*

A: ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-74:~/hw/5600/7$ cat /proc/meminfo

It is supposed to increase. But not working on my VM though.

## Q4

*Q:Do the same experiments as above, but now watch the other statistics (such
as CPU utilization, and block I/O statistics). How do they change when
mem is running?*

A: Utilization really does up and the I/O blocks (bi & bo) increases upon circumstances.

## Q5

*Q:Now let’s examine performance. Pick an input for mem that comfortably
fits in memory (say 4000 if the amount of memory on the system is 8 GB).
How long does loop 0 take (and subsequent loops 1, 2, etc.)? Now pick a size
comfortably beyond the size of memory (say 12000 again assuming 8 GB of memory). How long do the loops take here? How do the bandwidth numbers compare? How different is performance when constantly swapping
versus fitting everything comfortably in memory? Can you make a graph,
with the size of memory used by mem on the x-axis, and the bandwidth of
accessing said memory on the y-axis? Finally, how does the performance of
the first loop compare to that of subsequent loops, for both the case where
everything fits in memory and where it doesn’t?
?*

## Q6

*Q:Swap space isn’t infinite. You can use the tool swapon with the -s flag to
see how much swap space is available. What happens if you try to run mem
with increasingly large values, beyond what seems to be available in swap?
At what point does the memory allocation fail?*

A: 

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-74:~/hw/5600/7$ ./mem 400
allocating 419430400 bytes (400.00 MB)
  number of integers in array: 104857600
Killed

```

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-14-74:~/hw/5600/7$ ./mem 1000
allocating 1048576000 bytes (1000.00 MB)
memory allocation failed
```
