# Chap 6 Limited Durect Execution

## Restricted Operations

* I\O request issue
* Time sharing mechanism

### Solution:

#### Mode Switch:

* User Mode
    + System Call v.s. Procedure Call
    + trap instruction (raise & return-from-trap)

* Kernel Mode
    + Trap Table
    + system-call number
    + two phases: boot time vs running
    + LDE

### Control Switch

* A Cooperative Approach: Wait For System Calls or Illegal executions

* A Non-Cooperative Approach: The OS Takes Control
<br /> A timer interrupt configured at boot time to run every period where control is set back to the OS. Must preserve the state of the process running before terminating it.

* When being interrupted, the OS has to decide to switch or not. Such decision is made by scheduler.
* By switching stacks. the kernel enters one process and returns into a different one.

### Concurrency

* Method to avoid interupt comes in when dealing with interupt or system call:
    + Disable it
    + Lock
