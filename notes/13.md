# Address Spaces

## Time-sharing

* Issues
    + Has to take up whole memory
    + slow between memo and disk

* Solution
    + seperate memory, allot each process one area.
    + has to be careful for memory access

* Abstraction - Address Space
    + code (static) - live on top 
    + stack - grow negatively
    + heap - grow positively
    + static variables and so on

* virtualizing memory
    + transparency
    + efficiency
    + protected (nothing outside its space)
    +
